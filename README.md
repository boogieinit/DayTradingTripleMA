# TradingView - Triple Moving Average Indicator
This is an indicator for Trading View charts.
It uses three moving averages to avoid using up individual indicators (usefule if you have a free account).

It's hard coded to the indicators I typically use for day trading but you can edit it to make the "inputs" and labels generic.
I labeled them specific to keep it simple and avoid any confusion.

Averages used:
1. 9ema
2. 20ema
3. 200sma
